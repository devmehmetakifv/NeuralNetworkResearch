Neural network developing attempt in Java.

Here's my neural network developing attempt in Java. I tried coding a neural network to solve a specific problem but it failed probably because of bugs in backward propagation algorithm or complexity of mathematics. Anyways, it was a fun project and I learned a lot about neural networks and self training AIs.

You are mostly welcome to try to find and fix the bugs! You can find the documentation of the project from the repository. Make sure to read it for more details!
